                    <p>
                        I am a 23-year old software developer in-training. I currently live in Wisconsin. I am a graduate from Thinkful,
                        a coding boot camp, where I learned how to develop websites and write code. Some languages I 
                        learned are HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I also know some Java and Python, and I am learning more everyday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I am a hardworking, driven individual. I enjoy a challenge and love solving problems. 
                        I am a great team player and have a very positive outlook on difficult tasks, 
                        which makes work a lot more fun for me. I am a great addition to any team!

                    <p>
                        I started coding in high school and loved it immediately. When I first got to college, 
                        I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do. Two years of major changes later, I found Thinkful
                        and started my coding journey. I love the challenges presented in coding, and the satisfaction I 
                        get when solving any coding challenge is exciting. I thoroughly enjoy working with others. There 
                        is always more to learn, and working with people provides an opportunity to learn from them, and even teach them too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife, dog, and friends. I like to get out in nature
                        and explore while hiking. I also enjoy gaming, playing games like League of Legends or Rust. My favorite sport is 
                        Hockey, and when Covid settles down, I will join an adult league. My favorite hockey team is the Minnesota Wild!

                                This is a project I have been developing for Four Daughters Winery. It is meant to track the shipment

                                as access to the production version cannot be granted. <br>

                            <p class="projectDesc">
                                This project is still in the works, but most of the script is finished. Animal Crossing is a 
                                social simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. One aspect of this game is the
                                ability to catch fish and bugs, which different species are available at different game times, which matches
                                real life time. This website takes the current local time, and displays all fish and bugs that can currently be
                                caught. I will be updating this website to use Material UI for the front end display. <br>
